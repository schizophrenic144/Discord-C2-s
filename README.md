# Discord-C2-s
Discord resets every token thats found on github. This repo is used to reset malicious bot tokens.



# This is how the message they get looks like
Hey {Owner Name},

Safety Jim here! It appears that the token for your bot, {Bot Name} has been posted to the internet. Luckily, our token-scanning gremlins noticed, and have reset your bot's token - hopefully before anyone could have maliciously used it!

Your token was found here: https://github.com/schizophrenic144/Discord-C2-s/blob/main/tokens

Be more careful in the future, and make sure to not accidentally upload your token publicly!
